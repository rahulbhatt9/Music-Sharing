Our project is intended to be a collection of song user ratings websites that gives users the ability to rate their favorite songs out of a wide selection.

The functionality is intended to be quite basic, but later on we are thinking of adding more functionalities like the ability to click play on a song(
if a user wants to listen to it one more time, before choosing to leave a rating).

Rn, we allow users to rate songs on a scale of 1-10, we could moving forward extend this to a review instead of a simple rating based on a scale, where users
not only have the ability to give numerical feedback, but also verbal feedback. Our website is supposed to take an average across all user ratings and 
display that at the top so future users are aware of prior ratings of a song.
